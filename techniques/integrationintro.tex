\maketitle

We return to the direct study of integration with the goal of developing a variety of tools that we can use to compute antiderivatives. It will be assumed that you already have some experience with substitution, but we will see some examples of this again, and then go on to examine integration by parts, trigonometric substitutions, and partial fractions.
