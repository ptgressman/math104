  This course is built in Ximera.
\end{abstract}\maketitle

The philosophy behind Ximera is to make it possible to learn mathematics \textit{actively} online. \textbf{Wrong answers never hurt you.} You should go through these pages with paper and pencil in hand; take notes, draw pictures, do calculations. A number of exercises have hints: you are strongly encouraged (and sometimes structurally required) to do your best to solve an exercise before referring to the hints. After you solve it or after you tried unsuccessfully to solve the question, that's a good time to look at the hints to get some extra assistance or to verify aspects of your thinking that cannot be automatically graded (things like reasoning, etc.)

\section*{The Mechanics of Ximera}

See these links for information and examples of how this system is used:

 \section*{The Structure of This Course}
 
 Each topic in this course is addressed in a two-part way. You will first encounter a page with links to videos and online texts that should be the first place you go to learn new material. \textbf{There is a wealth of high-quality, open-source material on the web, and it is not the purpose of this course to reinvent the wheel.} The main sources that you are encouraged to use are
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \link[Calculus: Single Variable]{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKc2XOQp0dMwj9zAXD5LlWpriIXIrGaNb}, a series of short YouTube videos by Penn professor Robert Ghrist
 \item \link[OpenStax Calculus II]{https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2}, a web-based, open-source, modern Calculus textbook. It is approved by the Open Textbook Initiative of the American Institute of Mathematics.
 \end{itemize}
 
 In most cases, these materials should be sufficient for you to actively engage with the material we will study. \textbf{For every topic, it is expected that you will view videos and read textbook sections on your own \textit{before we discuss these topics in class}}. You should further work through all the included ``Examples'' on a topic before class. In particular, these same examples will often appear on pre-class Canvas quizzes.
 
 The second part of each topic is a list of exercises. These are generally more challenging than the initial examples and may take more time and some thought inside the classroom as well as outside in order to complete. The exercises sections will have sample questions from quizzes and old exams when relevant. It is highly recommended that you carefully work such questions and avoid guessing answers, as they are there for you primarily to test your own understanding of how to solve problems and not simply there for you to know their answers.
