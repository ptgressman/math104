\maketitle

In the next units, we take up the topic of sequences and series. These topics involve a substantial number of new ideas and are, on the surface, very different from the topics we have studied previously. As we move forward, however, we will see a number of ways in which sequences and series relate to the single variable calculus concepts of limits, differentiation, and integration.
