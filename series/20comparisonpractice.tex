\begin{exercise}
Suppose you wished to use the Direct Comparison Test to establish convergence of the series
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4 + n}. \]
Which of the following options below would be valid series for comparison? Select all that apply.
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison wouldn't be valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^5} \leq \frac{1}{n^4+n} \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2,\]
which is the wrong direction for the inequality when showing convergence.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4+n} \leq \frac{1}{n^4}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2,\]
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=4$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4+n} \leq \frac{1}{n^3}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2, \]
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=3$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4+n} \leq \frac{1}{n^2}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2, \]
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=2$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is not valid because the series (known as the \textit{harmonic series}) is not convergent, so no comparisons to it can establish convergence.
\end{expandable}
