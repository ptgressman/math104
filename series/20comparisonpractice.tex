\begin{exercise}
Suppose you wished to use the Direct Comparison Test to establish convergence of the series
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4 + n}. \]
Which of the following options below would be valid series for comparison? Select all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$}
\end{selectAll}
\begin{feedback}
Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison wouldn't be valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^5} \leq \frac{1}{n^4+n} \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2,\]
which is the wrong direction for the inequality when showing convergence.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4+n} \leq \frac{1}{n^4}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2,\]
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=4$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4+n} \leq \frac{1}{n^3}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2, \]
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=3$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4+n} \leq \frac{1}{n^2}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2, \]
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=2$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is not valid because the series (known as the \textit{harmonic series}) is not convergent, so no comparisons to it can establish convergence.
\end{expandable}
\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Suppose you wished to use the Direct Comparison Test to establish convergence of the series
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4 - n}. \]
Which of the following options below would be valid series for comparison? Select all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}
\end{selectAll}
\begin{feedback}
Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is not valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4} \leq \frac{1}{n^4-n^2}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2,\]
which is the wrong direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4-n} \leq \frac{1}{n^3}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2 \]
(because $n^4 - n = n(n^3-1)$ and $n^3 - 1$ is always greater than $n^2$ whenever $n \geq 2$.)
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=3$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because
\[ \frac{1}{n^4-n} \leq \frac{1}{n^2}  \ \ \text{ for all } n \geq 2, \]
(because $n^4 - n = n(n^3-1)$ and $n^3 - 1$ is always greater than $n$ whenever $n \geq 2$.)
which is the proper direction for the comparison inequality when showing convergence. Also key is that the $p$-series for $p=2$ is convergent.
\end{expandable}

\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Using only the comparison functions listed here:
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1+\sqrt{n}}, \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1},  \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}, \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n}, \]
 which of the following series can be proved to either diverge or converge using the Direct Comparison Test? (Select all that apply.)
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{3/2}+n^{1/2}}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 + n^{1/2}}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\ln (n+1)}$}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2-1}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{e^n  + 1}$}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}{\infty} \frac{1}{2n+3}$}
\end{selectAll}
\begin{feedback}
For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{3/2}+n^{1/2}}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This series \textit{is} convergent, but none of the allowed comparisons will work: Only $1/(n+1)$ and $1/(1+\sqrt{n})$ are larger than $1/(n^{3/2}+n^{1/2})$, but neither of those series converges.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 + n^{1/2}}$}:
\begin{expandable}
Comparison to $1/n^2$ works fine in this case.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\ln (n+1)}$}:
\begin{expandable}
$\ln (n+1) \leq n+1$ so $1/\ln (n+1) \geq 1/(n+1)$, so actually diverges by direct comparison.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2-1}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This series textit{is} convergent, but none of the convergent comparison options $1/n^2$ and $e^{-n}$ is greater than $1/n^2$.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{e^n  + 1}$}:
\begin{expandable}
The direct comparison $1/(e^n + 1) \leq e^{-n}$ works fine to show convergence of the series.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}{\infty} \frac{1}{2n+3}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This is a divergent series, but direct comparison with the allowed options doesn't work because $1/(2n+3)$ is smaller than the two divergent options $1/(n+1)$ and $1/(1+\sqrt{n})$.
\end{expandable}
\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}

%------------ Limit Comparison ------------------%

\begin{exercise}
Suppose you wished to use the Limit Comparison Test to establish convergence of the series
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4 + n}. \]
Which of the following options below would be valid series for comparison? Select all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$}
\end{selectAll}
\begin{feedback}
Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison wouldn't be valid because $1/n^5$ is too small: the limit of $1/(n^4+n)$ divided by $1/n^5$ is infinite, which is an inconclusive case.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because the limit $1/(n^4-n)$ divided by $1/n^4$ is $1$, which means that they both converge (because a $p$-series for $p=4$ is convergent).
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is valid because $1/n^3$ is a convergent $p$-series which is much larger than $1/(n^4+n)$, i.e.,
\[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{n^4+n}}{\frac{1}{n^3}} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^3}{n^4+n} = 0. \]
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}:
\begin{expandable}
Also works for the same reason as $1/n^3$: it's a convergent $p$-series and the original series divided by the comparison series goes to zero.
\end{expandable}

Expand for feedback on {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This comparison is not valid because the series (known as the \textit{harmonic series}) is not convergent, so no comparisons to it can establish convergence.
\end{expandable}
\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Suppose you wished to use the Limit Comparison Test to establish convergence of the series
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4 - n}. \]
Which of the following options below would be valid series for comparison? Select all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$}
\end{selectAll}
\begin{feedback}
For the Limit Comparison Test, non-dominant terms don't matter, so the results will be the same here as they were for the series $1/(n^4+n)$.
\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Using only the comparison functions listed here:
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1+\sqrt{n}}, \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1},  \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}, \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n} \]
, which of the following series can be proved to either diverge or converge using the Limit Comparison Test? (Select all that apply.)
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{3/2}+n^{1/2}}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 + n^{1/2}}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\ln (n+1)}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2-1}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{e^n  + 1}$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}{\infty} \frac{1}{2n+3}$}
\end{selectAll}
\begin{feedback}
For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{3/2}+n^{1/2}}$}:
\begin{expandable}
This series \textit{is} convergent, but none of the allowed comparisons will work: Only $1/(n+1)$ and $1/(1+\sqrt{n})$ are larger than $1/(n^{3/2}+n^{1/2})$, but neither of those series converges.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 + n^{1/2}}$}:
\begin{expandable}
Comparison to $1/n^2$ works fine in this case.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\ln (n+1)}$}:
\begin{expandable}
$\ln (n+1) \leq n+1$ so $1/\ln (n+1) \geq 1/(n+1)$, so the limit
\[ \frac{n+1}{\ln (n+1)} \rightarrow \infty \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty \]
so we get divergence by the divergence of the comparison series.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2-1}$}:
\begin{expandable}
Here the non-dominant term $-1$ in the denominator is no longer relevant, so limit comparison to $1/n^2$ works fine.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{e^n  + 1}$}:
\begin{expandable}
The direct comparison $1/(e^n + 1) / e^{-n} \rightarrow 1$ works fine to show convergence of the series.
\end{expandable}

For the series {$\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}{\infty} \frac{1}{2n+3}$}:
\begin{expandable}
Limit comparison with $1/(n+1)$ works great: $1/(2n+3)$ divided by $1/(n+1)$ equals
\[ \frac{n+1}{2n+3} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty. \]
\end{expandable}

\end{feedback}
