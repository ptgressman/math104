A tank contains 100 gallons of water in which 300 pounds of salt are dissolved. At some initial time, workers begin pumping in fresh water, i.e., containing no salt, at a rate of 10 gallons per minute. During the process, the tank is kept well-mixed and 20 gallons per minute of the resulting saltwater are pumped out of the tank (in particular, note that the tank will be empty after 10 minutes). Find the total amount of salt in the tank (measured in pounds) which remains 9 minutes after the process starts.
