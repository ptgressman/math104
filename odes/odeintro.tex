\maketitle

In the following sections, we will study some basic \textit{ordinary differential equations}, which are equations that involve an unknown function (rather than simply an unknown number) and its derivatives. In our case, we will restrict attention to \textit{first-order} ODEs, which involve only the unknown function $y(x)$, its parameter $x$, and its derivative $y'(x)$. We will discuss how to numerically and graphically approximate solutions of such ODEs, study two important types of first-order ODEs, and see some applications of these ODEs to various geometric and physical problems.
