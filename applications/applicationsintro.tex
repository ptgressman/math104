We study additional topics relating to applications of integration.

\maketitle

In the next several units, we will be returning to two fundamental questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item If we are unable to evaluate an integral exactly, can we at least determine an approximate answer?
\item Is there a way to integrate functions with vertical asymptotes and/or integrate functions on infinite domains instead of finite ones?
\end{itemize}
Along the way, we will study the idea of \textit{orders of growth}, which is a way of thinking about functions which makes it much easier to evaluate limits than is possible with l'H\^{o}pital's rule. We will also study probability theory as an application of integration and see how these ideas all come together in this particular context.
