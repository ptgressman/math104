\begin{exercise}%[APEX0505NINT05]
Consider the definite integral  \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 x^2\ dx\).
\begin{itemize}
\item	 The trapeziod rule with \(n=4\) gives the approximation
\[ \int_{-1}^1 x^2 \ dx \approx \answer{\frac{3}{4}}. \]
\item	Simpson's rule with \(n=4\) gives the approximation
\[ \int_{-1}^1 x^2 \ dx \approx \answer{\frac{2}{3}}. \]
\item	The exact value of the integral is
\[ \int_{-1}^1 x^2 \ dx = \answer{\frac{2}{3}}. \]
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}%[2018.2.1]
When estimating the integral below using Simpson's rule, what is the minimum number of intervals that would be required to guarantee that the approximation error does not exceed $2 \times 10^{-5}$? (Enter the smallest value which you know is correct.)
\[ \int_{-1}^0 e^{x \sqrt{6}} dx \]
\[ n \geq \answer{10}. \]
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}%[APEX0505NINT21]
Find \(n\) such that the error in approximating the given definite integral is less than \(0.0001\) when using:
\begin{itemize}
\item The trapezoid rule: $n \geq \answer{\sqrt{\frac{10000 \pi^3}{12}}} \approx 161.$ (Enter your answer as the exact result of your calculation; do not round or approximate.)
\item [(b)] Simpson's rule: $n \geq \answer{\left(\frac{10000 \pi^5}{180}\right)^{1/4}} \approx 12.$ (Enter your answer as the exact result of your calculation; do not round or approximate.)
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}%[2016.14]
How many equally spaced intervals $N$ are sufficient for the trapezoidal rule to estimate the value of the following integral  with an error less than or equal to $10^{-6}$? (Enter the smallest value which you know is correct.)
  \[ \int_{-1}^1 e^{x^2-1} dx. \]
  \[ N \geq \answer{2000}. \]
\begin{hint}
The second derivative of the integrand is $(4x^2 + 2) e^{x^2 - 1}$. Since $-1 \leq x \leq 1$, it follows that
\[ (4x^2 + 2) e^{x^2 - 1} \leq (4 \cdot 1 + 2) e^{0} = 6. \]
\begin{hint}
By the trapezoid rule error formula, the error $E$ satisfies
\[ |E| \leq \frac{6 (1 - (-1))^3}{12N^2} = \frac{4}{N^2}, \]
where $N$ is the number of intervals. 
\begin{hint}
To be sure the error is small enough, we need
\[ \frac{4}{N^2} \leq 10^{-6} \]
\end{hint}
\end{hint}
